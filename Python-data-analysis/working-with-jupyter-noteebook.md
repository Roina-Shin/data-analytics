## Working with Jupyter Noteebook

- First, install Anaconda on your PC. If your User folder name is not in ASCII characters (e.g. English), then consider pre-pending the PATH while installing Anaconda.


- After finishing installation, search **Anaconda Navigator** in the start menu. When you are in the Navigator UI, click Jupyter Notebook.

- If you see a window like below, you have basic things set up. If you have trouble launching Jupyter Notebbok, you need to open Anaconda Prompt and run a command: **jupyter notebook** to open it on your browser.

- Now, click on New and create a new notebook. There enter your first command to install packages. Enter **import pandas** with shift + enter.


```
import pandas
```

- Then enter **import matplotlib** and shift + enter.


```
import matplotlib
```

- Now, we have pandas and matplotlib installed. Open a new notebook and rename it.


- You can also work with markdown cells as well as code cells. You can refer to this site if you want to learn the markdown syntax.

- Another useful tip is that you can import some library and press **shift + tab** keys. Then it will shows you a documentation.
